Koliery - Колеры  in belarussian - meaning colors is a game inspired by the
Sega Columns and the ISS Colours for the Atari 500.

It was developed using pixi.js in 2020 while I was in Minsk Belarus, but not released until 2024.  
For a long time I forgot this project, but decided to release it now :)

You can [play it online](https://mateus.digital/koliery)

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.


## Building


```powershell
git clone https://github.com/mateus.digital/koliery
cd koliery

./scripts/build-static.ps1 ## Builds the game.
./scripts/deploy.ps1       ## Deploys it to a server.
```

## Dependencies:

The project was created by using Pixi.js and Chroma.js, but everything needed
is included on the project itself - so should be no external dependencies.

## Thanks to:

I used a lot of free and open resources, for which I'm most grateful!
